A main focus of my current research is identification of Australian ticks. As such I have developed the following resource that I have made freely available to help with tick identification.

You can also find a copy available on my research gate profile [Australian Tick (Ixodida) Identification Guide](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.20101.99040).

> Please don't hesitate to contact me directly for advice or assistance with morphological identification of Australian ticks ([contact page](contact.html)).
